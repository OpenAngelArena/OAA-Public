  <p>Open Angel Arena is a modern reimagining of the classic Angel Arena game mode. It was made by a group of passionate Angel
    Arena players that grew unhappy with the current iterations on the workshop. So we took it into our own hands to remake
    the game from scratch, revisiting old features while modernizing and streamlining the gameplay. It is a highly competitive
    game and there is a lot to learn. If you plan on joining the tournament I recommend you start practicing soon.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Most heroes are viable</strong>, including supports, casters and tanks. In fact, supports are absolutely essential
      to many strategies.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>All items are upgradeable</strong>. This allows for a wide range of possible item builds and for an even wider range
      of possible strategies. Have you ever wanted to play attack damage Elder Titan using the 100% lifesteal talent or use
      Lunas ultimate to rain death and stuns on an entire team? In Open Angel Arena these strategies are not only possible
      but actually viable. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>New custom items</strong>, designed by the community and carefully balanced before being added.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bosses have been redesigned to be an integral part of the game and have been made more interesting</strong>. To upgrade
      items you have to kill bosses, often as early as 10 minutes into the game and then regularly for the rest of the match.
      A killed boss respawns as a new, stronger boss with new abilities. Bosses in OAA have various mechanics that you will
      have to deal with while battling them and aren’t simple DPS tanks.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Duels have been redesigned to include objectives that encourage players to fight and enable objective based gameplay</strong>.
      There are multiple different duel arenas that you can be placed into and you will always be playing in a duel. If there
      is a 1v1 in one arena there is also a 4v4 in a different one and so on.</li>
    <li>To win the game you must win a Final Duel.
      <strong>The first team to 100 points will trigger a Final Duel. The team with 100 points then needs to win this Final Duel
        to win the game</strong>. If they don’t then the games score limit gets extended by 10, putting it into overtime.
      This goes on until a team wins a Final Duel.</li>
    <li>Fountain camping has been eliminated from the game.</li>

    <a href="https://github.com/OpenAngelArena/oaa">our GitHub</a>. We are always looking for new people to help with the game. It’s a fun experience and if you are a new
    developer the best experience you can get is to simply work on a game. If you work on Open Angel Arena you can also get
    feedback on your work by professional developers. You can find the developer discord in the installation instructions
